# OBD2-Scanner-Library

A lightweight and flexible **multi-platform OBD-II communication library**.  
This project provides a single codebase that can be compiled for:

- **Arduino** (compatible with popular CAN shields)
- **Raspberry Pi Pico SDK**
- **Linux** (using [SocketCAN](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/networking/can.txt))

With this library, you can send OBD-II requests and parse ECU responses, making it easy to build custom diagnostic tools, loggers, or embedded applications.

**Attention, this project is still in development(not finished)**

## âœ¨ Features
- Multi-platform support (Arduino, Pico SDK, Linux).
- CAN bus communication via SocketCAN or hardware CAN controllers.
- Easy interface for sending OBD requests (`mode`, `PID`).
- Ready for integration into diagnostic or telematics projects.
- Lightweight, no external dependencies beyond platform requirements.
